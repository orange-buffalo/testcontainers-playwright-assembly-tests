# Assembly tests for testcontainers-playwright

This project contains a set of tests that are run against the 
[testcontainers-playwright](https://github.com/orange-buffalo/testcontainers-playwright) distribution. They include
different type of projects (e.g. Java and Kotlin), with different versions of related libraries (e.g. Kotlin JVM).

The intention is to ensure compatibility of the library with different runtimes it claims supported.
